### Project Title
**Explore US Bike Share Data**

### Description
In this project, I made use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the US â€” Chicago, New York City (NYC), and Washington. I assembled code from imported data to answer interesting questions by computing descriptive statistics. I constructed a Python script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience when launched in the terminal to present these findings.
