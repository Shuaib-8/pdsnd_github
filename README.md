### Project Title
**Explore US Bike Share Data**

### Description
In this project, I made use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the US â€” Chicago, New York City (NYC), and Washington. I assembled code from imported data to answer interesting questions by computing descriptive statistics. I constructed a Python script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience when launched in the terminal to present these findings.

**Datasets**

Randomly chosen data for these three cities is provided for the first six month month of 2017 - all of these data files contain six columns:

Start time | End time | Trip Duration | Start Station | End Station | User type |
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
(e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57) | (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53) | in seconds - (e.g., 776) | (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave) | (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave) | (Subscriber or Customer)


The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

Gender | Birth year
--- | --- |
Male/Female | YY-MM-DD

**Statistics computed**

Code was written to provide the following information:

1) *Popular travel times*

* most common month
*  most common day of week
* most common hour of day

2) *Popular stations and trip*

* most common start station
* most common end station
* most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

3) *Trip duration*

* Total ```(SUM)``` travel time
* Average ```(MEAN/AVG)``` travel time

4) *User info*

* counts of each user type
* counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
* earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
